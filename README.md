Django-based website to store unavailable media centers. You can download any media from YouTube and SoundCloud for free. One of the important things about YouBute is that it's free and available for anyone. It has delpoyed on the PythonAnyWhere server which makes it accessible for any user in anywhere. Use YouBute [here](https://youbute.pythonanywhere.com).

# Set it Up
I prefer you to watch the [Postern process](https://github.com/lnxpy/postern) to set up YouBute locally.

# Preview
Now, you should have something like this. You can change templates, add new views, add new features, and make it ready for the deployment on your specific server. Enjoy it.
