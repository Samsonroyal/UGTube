Django-based website to store unavailable media centers. You can download any media from YouTube and SoundCloud for free. One of the important things about YouBute is that it's free and available for anyone. It has deployed on the PythonAnyWhere server which makes it accessible for any user anywhere. Use YouBute [here](https://youbute.pythonanywhere.com).

# Set it Up
I prefer you to watch the [Postern process](https://github.com/lnxpy/postern) to set up YouBute locally.
You just need to..

- Clone the YouBute
- Create your virtual environment
- Migrate your database
- Run up your project

__All these steps are explained in the Postern process__.

# Preview
Now, you should have such a thing on your local browser. You can change the templates, add new views, add new features, and make it ready for the deployment on your specific server. Enjoy it.
